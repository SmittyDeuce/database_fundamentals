1. Analyze and describe how the one-to-one relationship between Vehicles and Rental_Agreements will 
handle scenarios such as new vehicle additions, rental agreement updates, and vehicle availability checks.


When it comes to new additions, a new vehicle will be marked "available" untils its gets rented out
this will create a new rental agreement ID that will also link with the vehicle through its ID as 
a foreign key. making this a one to one ensures that only one vehicle can be ties to one rental 
agreement.

As for rental agreement Updates, that all will be done directly to the table if usch needs arise such as changing
agreement dates and since its one to one it'll also affect to the vehicle tied to it.

To check for Vehichle availability the system would check the Rental_Agreements table for the vehicle in question.
and if there is an active rental agreement then the vehicle is unavailable, if not then it is.
