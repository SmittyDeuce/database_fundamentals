    1. Provide a written analysis explaining how your schema design adheres to the principles of normalization.

        Each entity table has only one value in each cell that are dependent on the PK and when it comes to non primary keys
        they are not dependent on each other.


    2.Discuss specific examples from your design that demonstrate 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF.

        When it comes to 1NF each column must only contain one value and each val must be in own cell. 
        For Book Table: ID, name, genre, author_id, and price contains atomic vals. e.g name only stores the book name
        
        As for 2NF it requires the table is in 1NF and that all non-key attributes are fully 
        functionally dependent on the primary key.
        For Authors Table: all columns outside of the primary key are dependent on the key

        Lastly for 3NF it requires that the table is in both 1NF and 2NF and an attribute that is not a primary key
        is not dependent on another non-primary key.
        For  Customers Table: name, email and phone are directly dependent on the primary key
